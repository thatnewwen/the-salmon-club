  <h2 class="subtitle" style="text-align: center">About</h2>
  <p>This informal book club is aimed at political education; focusing on topics like race, gender, sexuality, women of color feminism, modes and structures of oppression, colonial/post-colonialism, ethnic studies, neoliberal critique, comparative racialization, and more.  While this group looks to develop a critical lens, we look to focus on all genres of relatively accessible texts- with literature, journalism, academic work, and films.  Furthermore, this group also intends to explore topics of interest to its members, and to gather and collect readings relevant to the groupâ€™s own interests and needs.</p>

  <p>The main goals of this group are the following: 1) To gain political education and new perspectives and tools for critical thinking and analysis, and 2) To build a thriving and supportive community.   </p>
